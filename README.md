# Sensing Mills Purple Air API Accessor

Outputs a csv file of data for a given set of sensor ids and API key.
Does not utilize environment variables (but it could!) to read API key or sensor ids.

## Getting Started
1. Install NodeJs (https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download this project using git hub
3. Edit index.mjs to have your API key and sensor ids
4. Open up the command prompt and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the code
5. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to download the data for the sensor ids you put in in step 3

You can make this easier by installing Visual Studio Code and opening the folder where you downloaded the code.  If you do you can run the command from `package.json` and edit the files all in one place!
